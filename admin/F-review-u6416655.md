Review Comments:

Warring StatesGame.java: Task 8 (getFlags() method):

1.Hala writes good codes by using abstract data type - Hashmap, so we can map the value through the key easily. She has a deeper understanding of the Hashmap and perfectly uses the get() and put() method of Hashmap in the task.

2.The comments Hala writes are clear, because every step has comments and simple languages make me understand more easily.

3.I think Hala's decomposition is not very good, because she does not use other people's methods. She writes all functions of task 8 in one method.

4.Hala's codes follow Java code conventions.The Variable names in task 8 all start with lower case, and use upper case for subsequent words. For example: playersCards, playerMove, moveLeft, etc.
Furthermore, the style of Hala's codes are consistent throughout. For instance, during the whole task, she uses 3 iterations and they are all 'for' statement and does not use 'foreach' statement. Meanwhile, names in task 8 have same naming style. 
However, the variable playerMove is assigned but never accessed.

5.In Hala's codes, I do not find any bug that may make the  whole project function incorrectly.
