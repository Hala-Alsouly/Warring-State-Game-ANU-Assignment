* The method setFlags(ArrayList<String> collectedCard, int playerId ) in class Game.
* The method setPlayersCollection(Button c, int playerId) in class Game.
* The method getPopup()in class Game

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of <...> came from a discussion with <...>

* The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
